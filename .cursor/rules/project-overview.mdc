# Project Overview

## Purpose

This is a Fastify-based REST API that defines and correlates QR codes with their data. The project serves as a learning platform where all code should be understood and verified.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES Modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **Framework**: Fastify v5.6.2 - A fast and low overhead web framework
- **Database**: MongoDB v7.0.0 via `@fastify/mongodb` plugin
- **QR Code Generation**: `qrcode` library v1.5.4
- **Environment**: `dotenv` for environment variable management

## Project Structure

```
get-ducked-api/
├── index.js                 # Main application entry point
├── routes/
│   └── qrCode/
│       └── index.js        # QR code route handlers
├── .env.example            # Environment variable template
├── docker-compose.yml      # MongoDB container setup
└── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Dependencies Explained

- **Fastify**: Chosen for its performance and plugin architecture. It's faster than Express and has built-in async/await support.
- **@fastify/mongodb**: Provides MongoDB connection and database access via `fastify.mongo.db`
- **qrcode**: Library for generating QR code images/data
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from `.env` file (only in non-production/test environments)

## Development Environment

- MongoDB runs via Docker Compose on port 27017
- API server runs on port 3000
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` file (see `.env.example`)

## Learning Goals

This project emphasizes understanding over speed. All generated code should:

- Be explained clearly
- Follow established patterns
- Include comments where concepts might be unfamiliar
- Be verified as understood before moving forward
