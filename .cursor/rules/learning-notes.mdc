# Learning Notes

## Learning Philosophy

This project is a learning platform. The goal is understanding, not just working code. Every piece of code should be understood before moving forward.

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing generated code, ask yourself:

1. **Do I understand what this code does?**
   - Can you explain it in plain English?
   - Do you know what each function/method does?

2. **Do I understand why this approach was chosen?**
   - Why this pattern over alternatives?
   - What are the trade-offs?

3. **Do I understand how the pieces fit together?**
   - How does this route connect to the database?
   - How does data flow through the application?

4. **Do I understand potential issues?**
   - What could go wrong?
   - How are errors handled?
   - Are there edge cases?

## Questions to Ask About Generated Code

### About Fastify

- Why do we use `await` when registering plugins?
- What's the difference between `request.params` and `request.query`?
- How does Fastify's plugin system work?
- Why do we return objects from route handlers?

### About MongoDB

- How does `findOne` differ from `find`?
- What happens if a query returns no results?
- Why do we create indexes?
- How does MongoDB handle duplicate keys?

### About Async/Await

- Why are route handlers async functions?
- What happens if we forget `await`?
- How does error handling work with async/await?

### About Project Structure

- Why are routes organized in separate files?
- How does the plugin registration work?
- Why do we use ES modules instead of CommonJS?

## Learning Workflow

1. **Generate code** - Let AI create the initial implementation
2. **Read and understand** - Go through each line
3. **Ask questions** - Don't hesitate to ask "why" or "how"
4. **Experiment** - Try modifying code to see what happens
5. **Verify understanding** - Explain it back in your own words

## Common Learning Moments

### Understanding Plugin Registration

```javascript
await fastify.register(import('./routes/qrCode/index.js'), {
  prefix: '/qrCode',
});
```

**What to understand:**

- Why `await` is needed
- How the prefix works
- What happens during registration
- How routes become available

### Understanding Database Queries

```javascript
const qrCode = await qrCodesCollection.findOne({ id: id });
```

**What to understand:**

- How MongoDB queries work
- What the query object means
- Why we use `await`
- What happens if nothing is found

### Understanding Route Handlers

```javascript
fastify.get('/:id', async (request, reply) => {
  const { id } = request.params;
  // ...
});
```

**What to understand:**

- How URL parameters are extracted
- The difference between `request` and `reply`
- Why handlers are async
- How responses are sent

## When to Ask Questions

Ask questions when:

- You see a pattern you don't recognize
- Code does something unexpected
- You're not sure why a choice was made
- You want to understand alternatives
- Something seems overly complex

## Learning Resources

- Fastify Documentation: https://www.fastify.io/
- MongoDB Node.js Driver: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/
- ES Modules: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules

## Remember

- **There are no stupid questions** - Understanding is the goal
- **Code should be explainable** - If you can't explain it, ask
- **Experimentation is learning** - Try things, break things, fix things
- **Understanding > Speed** - Take time to understand before moving on
